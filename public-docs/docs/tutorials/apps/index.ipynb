    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to creating reports by running the computation on your own notebook, pipeline, or server, you may want to deploy Python scripts or notebooks to Datapane so they can be scheduled, be run with parameters, or run in response to API events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datapane provides an app platform, so you can generate reports in an automated fashion, in addition to creating them in your local environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you deploy your script or notebook as an app, it can be run in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps can be run with parameters entered through friendly web forms, which allows you to create interactive, self-service reporting tools for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Parameters and forms](/tutorials/apps/parameters-and-forms){ .md-button }\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On a schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps can generate and update reports on a schedule, allowing you to create \"live\" dashboards and automated reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scheduling report runs](/tutorials/apps/scheduling){ .md-button }\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Through an API\n",
    "\n",
    "You can trigger report generation through our API, which allows you to generate reports in response to events from other tools, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, or your own product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying an app\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a local Python script or notebook which creates a report using Datapane's `Report.upload` method (see [Creating a Report](../../reports/tut-creating-a-report.md)), you can deploy it to Datapane using the CLI. &#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an example of a COVID report, which will be returned to the user when they run our app using the Datapane web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We recommend creating only one report per app. As many can be created as needed; however, only the last one in each app will be tracked in the web interface.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We'll place the folloding in a file named `simple_script.py`."
