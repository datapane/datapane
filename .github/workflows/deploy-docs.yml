# We use a separate workflow so we don't leak deployment keys in the PR workflows.
# Keys are tied to the 'docs-deploy' environment, which can only be accessed on the 'master' branch.

# IMPORTANT: You have to merge changes to this file to 'master' before they'll be executed.

# NOTE: We do not checkout any repository (ours or theirs):
#       - Avoids Remote Code Execution (if we check out their branch)
#       - Avoids user confusion when changes they make are not reflected (such as changing the Taskfile.yml)
#       - GitOps based tools (wrangler) need to be configured explicitly

# secrets:
# DOCS_CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_API_TOKEN::
# - Grants edit access to Cloudflare Pages on the Datapane Account
# - TTL of 2 months
# - instructions here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create/

# Future:
# - implement 'workflow_dispatch' so we can manually trigger deploys
# - implement Github Deployments to associate a deployed page with a PR (better reviews)
# - Pages Cleanup for merged PR
