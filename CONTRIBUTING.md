## How to contribute to Datapane

#### **How is Datapane developed?**

Datapane CLI and library is an open-source product developed by the Datapane team and open-source contributors.

To ease development we do most development within an internal monorepo and mirror changes to this repo directly as they are commited.

We really value open-source contributions and PRs to this repo. Our process for integrating them into our workflow is to merge the PR to this repo,
merge the changes back into to our monorepo, and then repush them back here - this may alter the commit hashes but not the history - ensuring that you correctly attributed for your PR and commits.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

-   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/issues).

-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

-   Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

-   Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

-   That's great - it's always good to hear feedback and new ideas!

-   If it's a large feature, consider discussing on our [discussions board](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/discussions) and start writing code.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

-   Ask any questions on our [GitHub discussions board](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/discussions).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Datapane community?**

Datapane is a joint startup and community effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join to add any features you are interested in!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
