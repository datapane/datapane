# datapane-docs-beta

The new Datapane documentation.

# Requirements

1. `poetry`, as per [their instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
2. `chromium`, through your package manager:

    _we will pick up `chromium` or `chromium-browser` from your `$PATH`_

    - MacOS: `brew install chromium`
    - Fedora: `sudo dnf install chromium`

# Generating the docs

1. Run `poetry run ./nbbuild.sh` to execute all Jupyter notebooks and generate Datapane reports and image previews.
2. Run `poetry run mkdocs build` to generate static site in `site/`.

`poetry run mkdocs serve` can be used to serve locally.

# Embedding reports and previews

1. Save your report to the same directory as the notebook:

    ```python
    report.save(path="simple-report.html")
    ```

2. Use `dpdocsutils` to:

    - embed the interactive report (`iframe=True`),
    - or insert a generated preview image that hyperlinks to the interactive report (`iframe=False`, default)

    ```python
    from dpdocsutils import previews
    previews.embed_local_report('/tutorials/basics/simple-report.html', width="100%", height=400)
    ```

3. Mark the cell with the metadata tag `remove_input` so we only see the output.

# Hiding input and/or output

Use metadata to show or hide input/output cells in notebooks.

-   `remove_input`, e.g. for cells containing preview code from `dpdocsutils`.
-   `remove_all_output`, e.g. for the cells outputting information after calling `.save()` or `.upload()`.
-   `remove_cell`, e.g. when you want something executed without displaying input or output.
