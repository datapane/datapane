## Scheduled Maintenance Windows

Datapane deploys new versions of our software on a regular basis to fix bugs and add new features. We reserve a deployment window on **Saturdays at 10am BST for up to 15 minutes.** We won't use it every week, and most deployments should take less than a minute.&#x20;

Here's what you can expect to happen during this period,&#x20;

-   **Access to your account may be unavailable**, and reports and scripts will not be accessible until the maintenance is complete.
-   **Scheduled Datapane scripts will not run during this time**, but they will continue to run once maintenance resumes
-   **Reports may be unavailable for viewing**. After the maintenance ends, these reports will be immediately available. Previously generated secure signed URLs will continue to work.&#x20;

We will let you know if the planned maintenance period changes, and will alert you immediately if a deployment goes over 15 minutes of downtime. We know Datapane is a key part of your day-to-day workflow, and we appreciate your patience as we work to keep our platform in great shape and ship new features.

**Questions?** If you have questions or concerns about any scheduled maintenance, or if you spot anything unusual after itâ€™s complete, please email [support@datapane.com](mailto:support@datapane.com) and we'll get back to you ASAP.
