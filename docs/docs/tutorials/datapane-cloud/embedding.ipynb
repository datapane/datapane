Sites that support oEmbed allow you to just paste the link to the report, and will handle the embedding automatically. Sites that support iframes, including your own websites and pages, simply require you to copy and paste the embed code from your report page on Datapane. You can find examples of embedded reports throughout these docs.\n",

    "Learn how to embed subsets of your reports via queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, your report will have different blocks, but you may wish to share only a subset, for instance it's often useful to embed a specific chart or dataset into another platform - especially if you are refreshing it on a cadence.&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating a report for each block, Datapane provides an `block_name` query parameter you can add to your report link that allows you to query your report, so you can embed only the relevant blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few of the most common examples and use-cases you will encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying by Block name\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to embed only a single block is to assign a `name` to your block when creating it, e.g. `dp.Plot(plot, name=\"my-plot\")`, and then add a query param to your embed URL as follows:&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://datapane.com/u/user/reports/report-name?block_name=my-plot\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `?block_name=my-plot` is a URL param that will extract any report block with the `name` of `my-plot`. Note that your block name cannot contain spaces.&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the plot in [this report](https://datapane.com/leo/reports/continent\\_covid\\_cases) has a name of `block-7`, and so the following query will select just that plot: [https://datapane.com/leo/reports/continent\\_covid\\_cases/?block\\_name=block-7](https://datapane.com/leo/reports/continent\\_covid\\_cases/?block\\_name=block-7)\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "    \n",
    "    These queries can be applied to embedded reports, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/continent-covid-cases/embed/?block\\_name=block-7](https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/continent-covid-cases/embed/?block\\_name=block-7)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying by Block type and index\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, Reports are comprised of multiple block types, such as `Plot`, `Table`, `Text`, and so on - we can select just blocks of a specific type using [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath), and even select the specific index of a particular block type or a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say there are both Table and Plot blocks in your report, and you want to only embed the plots from your report. Simply add `/?blocksquery=//Plot` at the end of the report link. For example, to extract all the plots in [this report](https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/google-trends/) you can use the following query,\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/google-trends/embed/?blocksquery=//Plot](https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/google-trends/embed/?blocksquery=//Plot)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to query only the first plot of the report, just add an index to the Plot query, i.e., `/?blocksquery=//Plot[1]`, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/google-trends/embed/?blocksquery=//Plot\\[1\\]](https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/google-trends/embed/?blocksquery=//Plot\\[1]) will select the first plot, and [https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/google-trends/embed/?blocksquery=//Plot\\[2\\]](https://datapane.com/u/leo/reports/google-trends/embed/?blocksquery=//Plot\\[2]) will the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "    Querying by Block type will also remove all layout information from the report, making it easier to view when embedded"
