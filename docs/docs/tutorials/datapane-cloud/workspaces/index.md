# Workspaces

## Workspaces

When you sign up for a Datapane Cloud account, a Workspace will automatically be created for you. A Workspace is a shared space for you and your team to collaborate and share apps and [Projects](../projects.md){:target= "\_blank"} together.

You will be asked to name your Workspace and invite a few members to get started. Inviting members to your Workspace is optional at this stage and can be skipped for now. It can be done later from [Workspace settings](../workspaces/workspace-settings.md){:target= "\_blank"}.
