# Managing members

You can invite members to your Workspace so your whole team has access to a shared environment for reports and scripts.

### Inviting members

You can invite members to your Workspace by going to the _Members_ tab in _Workspace settings_. Invited members will receive an email with a secure signup link valid for 72 hours.

### Roles and projects

Every member must be assigned to one of our four system roles:&#x20;

1. **Viewer**: can view reports and run scripts&#x20;
2. **Editor**: all permissions of viewer, plus creating reports and scripts
3. **Admin**: all permissions of editor, plus settings, member management and billing
4. **Analyst**: can run apps (dynamic reports) but can't create reports or apps via the API. This role is only available for Enterprise users.

### Advanced

If you need to delete a member, click on the _Edit_ button next to the member's name. From here you can mark the member as not active. They will no longer be able to log in, and will not be counted towards your member count for your next payment.
