    "# Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to authenticate with Datapane Cloud or a Datapane Teams server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datapane has a server component which you can access through the CLI and Python library and requires an authentication token. You can authenticate through either the CLI or the Python library, and all future requests will automatically be authenticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datapane Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "_Datapane Cloud_ is hosted on [datapane.com](https://datapane.com) and is available as a free server where you can upload reports. The API and CLI are configured to use this server by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sign up\n",
    "\n",
    "You can sign up for a free account via [our website](https://datapane.com/accounts/signup) or via CLI:&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ datapane signup\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Login\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, you'll see a code snippet with `datapane login` and your token. Login by running this code snippet or Python library using this key. All future requests from both the CLI and Python library will automatically be authenticated. Reports are unlisted by default, and you can share them publicly or privately (see [Uploading and Sharing](reports/publishing-and-sharing/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you need your API key in the future, you can find it in [your settings page](https://datapane.com/settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "=== \"CLI\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    $ datapane login\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "=== \"Python Library\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    import datapane as dp\n",
    "    dp.login(token=your_token)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datapane Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "_Datapane Teams_ provides private hosted servers and supports on-premise instances for organizations. In such a case, log in to your instance, for instance `https://your-company.datapane.net` , using the credentials provided to you by your admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to when using the free _Datapane_ instance, your home page will indicate your API key and you will be able to authenticate by passing in your API key to the login command. You will need to pass in the full URL of your server (including the `https://`) to the login command as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=== \"CLI\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    $ datapane login --server=https://[your-server].datapane.net\n",
    "    Enter your API Key: [paste your API key here]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "=== \"Python Library\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    import datapane as dp\n",
    "    dp.login(token=your_token, server='https://[your-server].datapane.net')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info \n",
    "\n",
    "    The CLI supports multiple profiles using the --env flag, so you can easily work with both the default _Datapane_ instance and your private enterprise instance at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    $ datapane --env default login\n",
    "    $ datapane --env acme login --server=https://acme.datapane.net\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check your Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "To check you have access and which account you are logged in as, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "=== \"CLI\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    $ datapane ping\n",
    "    ```\n",
