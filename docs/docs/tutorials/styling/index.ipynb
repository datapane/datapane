    "# Styling and Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "\n",
    "    You'll need to be logged into [Datapane.com](http://datapane.com) or your Teams instance to use this feature - it is not currently supported in the open-source version.\n",
    "\n",
    "â€ŒOne of the challenges of building reports is the dependence on a Python environment. Datapane now allows you to create and edit reports directly on our server, meaning it's much easier to onboard non-technical users and make small changes to existing reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our web editor can be used on any of your existing reports - just click 'Edit' and you'll see a side-by-side view with the left hand side showing the report XML structure, and the right hand side showing a report preview. You can then edit the XML to update the report.&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../img/tutorials/styling-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a report directly on Datapane.com by clicking the '[Create Report](https://datapane.com/report-from-template/)' button.&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Inserting blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can enrich your report by adding special blocks (click 'Insert Blocks'). For example, clicking on the Formula block will insert the following snippet into the web editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<Formula>[[x^2 + y^2 = z^2]]</Formula>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click 'Preview', you'll see this display as follows:&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../img/tutorials/styling-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the content inside the blocks to add additional parameters like `name,`as well as block-specific parameters. For example, here's a group with 2 columns:&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<Group columns=\"2\", label=\"My_group\">\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "</Group>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Empty block\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a placeholder for a chart that you'll upload from Python later, use the `empty` block. The editor will auto-generate a `name` which you can modify, and then push up assets to from Python (see next section).&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uploading Blocks from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've created a report, you'll probably want to add some interactive plots and data from Python. You'll need the report`ID,` which you can find in the URL or in the editor bar by clicking `Insert Assets from Python`:&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../img/tutorials/styling-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to push up assets to an existing report from Python:&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. `report.upload`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This does a full refresh of everything in your report, overwriting any changes you may have made in the web editor - here's an example:&#x20;"
