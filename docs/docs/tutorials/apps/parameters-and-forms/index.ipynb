    "# Parameters and Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps can be parameterised, allowing them to dynamically generate reports\n",
    "through web forms or the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders commonly need to provide some configuration to your apps to enable self-service report generation. Datapane allows you to add parameters, which are presented to end users as **web forms**. This means that other people who have accounts on your instance can generate reports without worrying about code, notebooks, or setting up a Python environment.&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running & Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Input parameters can be defined in your `datapane.yaml` configuration file, where you can enter a schema and configure the inputs. In your Python code, the parameters which you define in this file are accessible in the `Params` dictionary. You can get an item from the dictionary with `Params.get([value_name], [default_value])`\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the previous example, the dataset we are pulling includes a few other useful parameters which people may want to graph. Let's add the ability for the end-user to choose from `new_cases_smoothed_per_million` , `new_deaths_smoothed_per_million`, `median_age`, and `gdp_per_capita` . Additionally, let's allow them to choose a subset of continents for the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we are going to add two parameters: `plot_field` and `continents` to the `parameters` section of our `datapane.yaml`. To configure what the end-user's form looks like, we can choose the type of widget. For the above, we're choosing a `enum` (which provides a dropdown select menu where the user must select one option), and a `list` (which allows the user to choose or more choices from a predefined list). We can also set the default parameters for each input and a description.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Full details of parameter configuration and available fields are provided in the [API reference](parameters.md#parameter-form-fields).\n",

    "    description: Field to plot\n",
    "    type: enum\n",
    "    choices: \n",
    "      - new_cases_smoothed_per_million\n",

    "    default: \n",
    "      - Asia\n",
    "      - North America\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use the `Params` object as you would when running on your Datapane instance, and we can customise our data and graph based on those inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll place the folloding in a file named `simple_script.py`."
