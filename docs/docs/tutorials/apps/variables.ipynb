    "# Environments & Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment allows you to set environment variables and docker image to use when running apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Please see the [Environment API Reference](https://datapane.github.io/datapane/teams.html#datapane.client.api.teams.Variable) for more details. You can also create Environments directly from the Web interface.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps often contain variables such as database keys and passwords, which you do not want embedding in your source code and visible to the outside world.&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you'll often want to include custom dependencies and packages outside those in our [default Docker image](/tutorials/apps/configuration-and-dependencies#docker-dependencies).&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "Datapane lets you specify your variables and Docker images through **Environments.**&#x20;\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new environment from Python, the CLI or the web interface. Adding multiple versions of environments with the same name will create new versions.&#x20;\n",
