# Datapane Enterprise

## Datapane Enterprise
If your team is using the Python data stack for analysis and visualization, but is still relying on a drag-and-drop BI tool to share results, _Datapane Enterprise_ provides an API-first way to share reports directly from Python. This enables data teams to use the tools they are gifted at to drive business decisions, and allows stakeholders to self-serve on what the data team is building, instead of going through a backlog.

In addition to providing secure, authenticated report sharing, _Datapane Enterprise_ allows automated report generation by allowing data teams to deploy their Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to the cloud. Reports can be generated from parameters entered through web forms, on a schedule, or on-demand through our HTTP and Python APIs.

Other features include:

-   APIs to utilise blobs and secrets in your scripts
-   [Whitelabel embedding](/tutorials/styling/global-styling/) of Datapane reports in your own products
-   [Groups and secure-sharing features](/concepts/datapane-enterprise/authentication-and-sharing/) to control access and share reports with external clients

See [Enterprise explanation](/concepts/datapane-enterprise) for more.
