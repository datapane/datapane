### :octicons-organization-24: Datapane Teams

![](img/releasenotes/cloud.png){ .docs-image }

We have launched **Team Workspaces** on Datapane Cloud.

Datapane Cloud is the best way to host and share your reports, dashboards, and apps.

With this release, Datapane Cloud users can now securely share reports with their team or clients by creating private workspaces and projects.

### :octicons-repo-template-24: Templates and Components Catalogs

<a src="/catalogues/blocks/table"><img class="docs-image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15690380/183948469-c76fa50f-e0a2-438a-b13c-9e58d6071c1c.png"></a>

Starting from this release, we are providing a series of templates and components which lower the barrier to building something awesome using Datapane and Python. Check them out in our new [Catalogue](catalogues/index.ipynb).

Our first templates include:

#### Classifier dashboard

A performance dashboard for classifiers. It can be used as a starting point for creating a Datapane report that highlights the performance of multiple classifiers on a dataset.

#### Social media dashboard

An engagement dashboard for social media. It can be used as a starting point for creating a Datapane report that highlights user engagement with social media channels.

#### Text-heavy report

A text-heavy report. It can be used as a starting point for creating a text-heavy Datapane report that starts off as a Jupyter Notebook.

### :octicons-code-square-24: Open-source Report Renderer

Prior to this release, our report renderer was a bundled and minified Javascript library which was not open to contributions. As part of porting our Report renderer from React to Vue.js, we've taken the step of open-sourcing the entire renderer, which you can check out [on GitHub](https://github.com/datapane/datapane/tree/master/projects/web-components/report).

| ---------------- | ------ |
| Python version   | 0.14.0 |

### Enterprise Renaming

In preparation for unifying our enterprise and public products, we're renaming and upgrading some of our core objects to make them easier to understand.

-   `Script` will be renamed `App`
-   `Blob` will be renamed `File`
-   The current `dp.File` block will be split into `dp.Media` and `dp.Attachment`
-   `Group` will be renamed `Project`
-   `Variables` will be combined with Docker images into a new `Environment` system

This is a **breaking change**, meaning that any new objects you create after the update will need to follow the new syntax. Your existing scripts/blobs/groups should continue to work.

### :octicons-bug-24: Other Bug Fixes and Improvements

-   Fixed a bug where we didn't show explanatory text for Report Notifications on Org
-   Fixed a bug where `dp.Blob.upload_file` gave an error for certain filetypes
-   Fixed a bug where nested groups didn't always display correctly in the embed view
-   Fixed a bug where table cells didn't display correctly on Safari browsers
-   Updated our report preview text to sound more professional
-   Added a Divider block (`dp.Divider`) for more layout control

## 21 September 2021

| Property         | Values |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Python version   | 0.12.1 |
| Breaking changes | False  |

### API-first Signup

In keeping with our vision of being a developer-friendly API-first product, we're launching a new onboarding experience for local client users. After installing Datapane, you'll be prompted to run the following command:

```
datapane hello-world
```

This will run some Python code to generate a local HTML report which demonstrates how the product works. After viewing that local report, you can run the following command to create an account and get an API key for hosting reports:

```
datapane signup
```

### :octicons-bug-24: Other Bug Fixes and Improvements

-   Improved `dp.Table` default styling
-   Added a SQL query runner to `dp.DataTable` for more advanced filtering and calculation logic
-   Fixed a bug where thumbnails weren't being generated for new reports

## **25 August 2021**

| Property         | Values |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Python version   | 0.12.1 |
| Breaking changes | True   |

-   `report.publish` is now called `report.upload`
-   `dp.Markdown` replaced with `dp.Text` for text content
-   `dp.Page` must use `title` parameter to set the page title, not `label`
-   Objects like `scripts`, `blobs` and `variables` now keep their original name instead of being converted to lowercase slugs, for instance `my variable` won't be renamed to`my_variable`. You may need to update any scripts to use the new names (or re-add variables / blobs with the older names).

### DataTable Improvements

-   Fixed encoding issue mismatch between `dp.Table` and `dp.DataTable`.
-   Allow column autosizing on double-click
-   You can now input uppercase strings in column filters

This is perfect for users with stricter security requirements who want to ensure that confidential data doesn't leave their system. We use docker-compose to ensure that you can get up and running within 15 minutes.
