Ronaldinho denies Blues interest

Fifa World Player of the Year Ronaldinho says he has no intention of leaving Barcelona to join Chelsea.

"I never said I wanted to play for Chelsea. I'm very happy where I am and want to carry on where I am," he said. "I want to be part of the history of Barcelona as a winning player. Barcelona has given more to me than I have to them." The Brazilian added: "From the first day I have had lovely surprises. Barcelona, for me, is perfect." Ronaldinho's words will reassure Barca after the Brazilian previously said he was interested in moving to England. He was quoted as saying: "What Chelsea are doing is absolutely amazing. I respect them a lot and can see maybe see myself living in London one day."

Barca meet Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League and Ronaldinho is expecting a tough time against the London outfit. "I hope we can reach the final of the Champions League, but it is a very strong competition," he said. "Chelsea are one of the highest-ranking teams."
