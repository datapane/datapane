Beckham hints at Man Utd return

England captain David Beckham said he would return to Manchester United if he ever leaves Real Madrid.

Beckham left United in July 2003 after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and has been linked with a return to London if he decided to move back to England. "If I ever leave I would go back to United and work with Sir Alex again, definitely," he told the Daily Mirror. "Manchester United were the club that I grew up with and felt that I would always be there my whole career." However, Beckham insisted he was happy at Real, and said he still had plenty to prove in Spain.

"I have been here for a year and a half and I have not played my best football in the past few months," he said. "But I am happy. I am playing with some of the best players in the world and I want to win the top prizes like the Spanish league and the Champions League." Meanwhile, Beckham said he would fight for his international place amid pressure from Manchester City's rising star Shaun Wright-Phillips. "He deserves his chance because of the way he has been playing and I am genuinely pleased to see him doing so well," he said.

"People ask me if I'm worried about him. I'm not worried because I am proud of the England team and I want the best for it. "I'm the captain. It's in my interests to have the best players in the team as well. "I am not a jealous person and I am pleased for young kids coming through. We are talking about team-mates of mine. "Shaun is a threat to me because he plays in the same position, but we can also play in other positions. "I believe I will still be in the England team in 2006. I believe I will be England captain for that World Cup."
