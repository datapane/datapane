Worthington praises classy Villa

Norwich boss Nigel Worthington said his side's defeat to Aston Villa emphasised the gap in quality between the Premiership and the Championship.

"I thought the Villa performance today was very good. I think it comes down to the quality," he said. "The jump from the first division into this level is a hefty leap. We're learning all the time. "Villa's second goal summed it up. We are on the attack, then Robert Green's picking it out at the other end." Worthington said he was happy with the performance of England Under-21 striker Dean Ashton on his Premiership debut after his Â£3m move from Crewe. "It was very difficult for him but I thought he did exceptionally well," he said. "He got hold of the ball and got shots in, which we've been shy on, so that's a big plus. It's his first Premiership game and he will find it a big step. "We've got to give him time and be patient with him because I know, and he knows, there is a quality footballer in there. "Once he gets attuned to the Premiership he will be one to watch."
