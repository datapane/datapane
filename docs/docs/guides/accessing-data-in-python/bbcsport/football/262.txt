Van Nistelrooy hungry for return

Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy said he was "hungry to play" as he returned to training on Tuesday.

The Dutch striker, 28, is closing in on a comeback after nearly three months out with an Achilles injury. "I can't wait to get back training and meet up with my team-mates again," he told the Daily Mirror newspaper. "I'm ahead of schedule and I've made good progress with my physio in Holland. I have been away from United for a long time, but I'm fit again." United boss Sir Alex Ferguson hinted at a return for Van Nistelrooy in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday. He said: "There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training." United did not lose any of the 14 games in which Van Nistelrooy was involved before his injury - although their form has remained good since he was sidelined. Their 2-0 derby win at Manchester City on Sunday made it 13 wins in 15 league games.

However, Van Nistelrooy is still the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals, despite being out since the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday.
