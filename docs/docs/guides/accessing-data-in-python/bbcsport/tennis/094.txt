Injured Roddick quits in Memphis

Andy Roddick has pulled out of his semi-final at the RMK Championships in Memphis after spraining his left ankle.

The American top seed was was supposed to face Dane Kenneth Carlsen, who now advances to the final against eighth seed Max Mirnyi of Belarus. He came through his semi-final against German second seed Tommy Haas 7-5 6-3. Roddick, the 2003 US Open champion, was hurt during his quarter-final win on Friday and had intensive treatment on his ankle to no avail. He attempted to loosen up his foot by jogging on Saturday, then tried to hit a couple of balls. "The first really kind of significant move I made I just knew that it wasn't going to happen for me," Roddick said. He decided to pass on a chance to win his second tour title in two weeks in part because he wants to be healthy for the US team's Davis Cup match against Croatia in a fortnight. "The repercussions of this injury wouldn't just affect me. It would affect my team-mates and playing for my country as well," Roddick said.
