Federer wins title in Rotterdam

World number one Roger Federer won the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam with a battling 5-7 7-5 7-6 victory over Ivan Ljubicic on Sunday.

The Swiss star was made to work hard by Ljubicic, who also lost to Federer in last month's final in Doha. The Croatian broke his serve for the first time in the tournament to take the first set, but Federer hit back and took the decider on a tie-break. He has now won his last 15 finals after triumphing in two hours and 42 minutes. Federer said: "Today it was very close and it could have gone either way but I'm happy I fought through because this might be a crucial victory for me for the rest of the season. "I knew I had to fight hard today and that's exactly what happened. "I played one shocking game to be broken. He took advantage of it and broke me to love but I still felt I gave that game away. "That haunted me all the way, right until match point. I fought well today so I'm happy."
