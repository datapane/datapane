Mauresmo fights back to win title

World number two Amelie Mauresmo came from a set down to beat Venus Williams and win the Diamond Games in Antwerp.

Mauresmo, who lost to Dinara Safina in the final of the Paris Indoor Open last week, beat the third seed 4-6 7-5 6-4 for her first title of the season. The Frenchwoman produced some superb volleys in the final set and claimed victory on her fifth match point after two hours and 18 minutes. "This was a great final for a great tournament," she said. "I am so happy because the quality of my game went up and up during the whole week until the final, this is the result of all the work I have done with my coach." Williams was seeking her third title in Antwerp having won it on her two previous visits in 2002 and 2003. The defeat means she has now gone 11 tournaments without a title, the longest drought of her career. "Amelie deserves her win, she played so well," she said.
