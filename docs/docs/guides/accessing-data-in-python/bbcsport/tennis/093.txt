Clijsters sets up Venus match-up

Kim Clijsters continued her comeback from a wrist injury with a 7-5 6-7 6-1 win over Russia's Nadia Petrova in round two of the Antwerp Diamond Games.

The Belgian will meet fellow former world number one Venus Williams in the quarter-finals after the American swept past France's Virginie Razzano 6-3 6-0. Clijsters, sidelined since October, edged a high-quality first set. But Petrova hit back in a second-set tiebreak before Clijsters pulled clear in the decider, breaking three times. "Everything's fine with the wrist," said Clijsters. "I could do everything I wanted to with my backhand - long backhand cross rallies, slicing. I really enjoyed every backhand.

"I had the intention of wearing Petrova down and I did. It was a relief to win a three-set match. "These are the kind of matches I have been looking forward to for a long time." And the Belgian is looking forward to facing a severe test from Williams. "A quarter-final against Venus is a nice prospect," said Clijsters. "I saw her play and she is very strong right now, completely focused. "It will be difficult on Friday, but fun as well." Third seed Williams, who will get a gold and diamond-encrusted racket should she add to her 2002 and 2003 event wins, was barely troubled against Razzano. "My tennis was very good today," she said. "But it is no surprise to me because I feel very healthy and have been working well lately."
