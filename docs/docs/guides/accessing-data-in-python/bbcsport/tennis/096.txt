Agassi into second round in Dubai

Fourth seed Andre Agassi beat Radek Stepanek 6-4 7-5 in the first round of the Dubai Tennis Championships.

The 34-year-old, moving well despite a hip problem which needed an injection, served well and won 80% of his first serve and 76% of his second. But the American could not break the Czech Stepanek until the final game of the first set and in the second he had to fight back after losing his serve. Agassi, making his first appearance at the event, received a standing ovation. He said: "I have had a few great days here in Dubai. I have waited a long time to be here, and I must apologise for being so late." Other first-day winners included Spaniards Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo, Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia and Germany's Rainer Schuettler. Ferrero, the 2001 champion, overcame Florian Mayer of Germany 6-3 6-4 while Robredo had to fight hard to beat Olivier Rochus of Belgium 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-5). Hrbaty crushed Omar Bahrouzyan of the United Arab Emirates 6-0 6-4 while Schuettler beat Younes Al Aynaoui of Morocco 6-0 6-1. Ferrero could now meet top seed Roger Federer - who faces qualifier Ivo Minar on Tuesday - in the second round. British rivals Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski will face each other in the opening round on Tuesday.
