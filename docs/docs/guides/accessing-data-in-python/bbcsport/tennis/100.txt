Sharapova overcomes tough Molik

Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova recovered from losing the opening set to win the final of the Qatar Open.

The second seed beat fourth-seeded Australian Alicia Molik 4-6 6-1 6-4 for her second title of the year. Molik, who had overcome top seed Amelie Mauresmo in Friday's semi-final, broke Sharapova in the third game of a first set she went on to win. But Sharapova recovered to build up a healthy 5-0 lead in the second set and she never looked back after that. Molik saw her game fall apart as Sharapova broke in the fifth game of the decider to lead 3-2. And although Molik stayed in touch, Sharapova held on to her serve and then finished off the match with an ace after saving a break point in the 10th game.

Sharapova said the key to her victory was her positive approach after losing the first set. "Alicia was dictating terms to me in the first set but in my mind I was always positive," said Sharapova. "In the first set I was not playing my own game, but in the second I decided to put some pace on the ball and put pressure on her serve and that worked." Sharapova said she will head to Los Angeles to be with her mother and have some rest after her recent hectic schedule. "I need some rest now and I am eager to see my mum and catch up with friends after all the travelling I've been doing."
