Wilkinson targets Ireland

Jonny Wilkinson says he is "massively positive" about his chances of playing some part in the Six Nations.

A knee injury has ruled him out of England's first two matches against Wales and France, but he is hoping to feature against Ireland on 27 February. "I'm coming on really well. The physios at England and Newcastle are as happy as they could possibly be at this point." said the England fly-half. Wilkinson has not played for England since their 2003 World Cup final win. "The injury is to my left leg so, as a kicker, I need to make sure I'm really right so I can play my usual game."

"All I can do is try to get back. It (the knee injury) happened two and a half weeks ago and the limit was then set of six to eight weeks, which is the second half of the Six Nations." "I'm just concentrating on doing my bit, which is the rehab. "All I can do is free myself up for selection and then see what people want to do with me, whether they want to play me or leave it." If he does not recover in time for England's Six Nations season, his next target would be the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. "I'm looking to play first for Newcastle, then think about England and only then will I think about the Lions." he said. "As with my other injuries, I'm taking it day by day."
