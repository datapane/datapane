Marshall set for Leeds move

All Blacks scrum-half Justin Marshall has agreed a two-year contract to play for Leeds from next season.

The 31-year-old has a release clause in his New Zealand contract which allows him to move after the 2005 Lions tour. "It is a really exciting challenge and something new for me," Marshall told BBC Sport. Leeds rugby director Phil Davies added: "Justin is a world class player who will add greatly to this group with his professionalism on and off the field." Marshall is the most capped New Zealand back of all time with 77 Tests behind him, but was left at home for the All Blacks' European tour in November. He did travel to England to captain the Barbarians against his international team-mates at Twickenham, and is intent on reclaiming his Test spot ahead of the Lions' visit in June. "I am committed to New Zealand rugby this season," he added. "I enjoy a good challenge and it would be great to face the Lions." Marshall is preparing to start training with the Canterbury Crusaders, whom he has helped to four Super 12 titles, on Monday ahead of the new season. His intended departure later this year comes with the blessing of All Blacks coach Graham Henry. "I fully understand why Justin is making the change at this stage of his career," Henry said. "While we never like losing world-class players from our ranks, there is no doubting that he has served New Zealand rugby well over a long period of time."
